To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.</p> <p>Section 1 -- Definitions.</p> <p>a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is      synched in timed relation with a moving image.</p> <p>b.

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international      agreements.</p> <p>e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.</p> <p>f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public      License.</p> <p>g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.</p> <p>h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights      under this Public License.</p> <p>i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards      commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of      this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for      other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital      file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is      no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the      exchange.</p> <p>j.

License grant.</p> <pre><code>   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n      the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n      exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n           in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n\n        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for\n           NonCommercial purposes only.\n\n   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n      its terms and conditions.\n\n   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n      6(a).\n\n   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n      Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n      all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n      and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n      Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n      necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n      Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n      (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n   5. Downstream recipients.\n\n        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n           recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n           receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n           Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n           Public License.\n\n        b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n           Material.\n\n   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n      provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n</code></pre> <p>b. Other rights.</p> <pre><code>   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n      licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n      privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n      the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n      Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n      Public License.\n\n   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n      reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n      the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n      purposes.\n</code></pre> <p>Section 3 -- License Conditions.</p> <p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.</p> <p>a. Attribution.</p> <pre><code>   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n      form), You must:\n\n        a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n           with the Licensed Material:\n\n             i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                Material and any others designated to receive\n                attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                designated);\n\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n\n           iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                warranties;\n\n             v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                extent reasonably practicable;\n\n        b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n           retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n        c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n           Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n           hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n      reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n      which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n      reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n      hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n      information.\n\n   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n      information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n      reasonably practicable.\n\n   4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n      License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n      Material from complying with this Public License.\n</code></pre> <p>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.</p> <p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p> <p>a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial      portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes      only;</p> <p>b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and</p> <p>c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</p> <p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p> <p>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p> <p>a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE.

WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p> <p>c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and      waiver of all liability.</p> <p>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.</p> <p>a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License      terminate automatically.</p> <p>b.
