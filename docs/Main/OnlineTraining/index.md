# Online Training Requirements 

The following training will be started by all students on Wednesday (09APR25) after land navigation. Students will complete each module, print off the certificate of completion, and turn in that certificate to CPT LaGroue for each class they complete for record keeping. **This is a prerequisite for SERE**, the faster students turn them in the sooner they will be slotted for SERE (if no medical or S-2 issues).

Students may email the certificate to CPT LaGroue.
